# Example images

These SVG files are tiny preview sketches to give beginners a quick visual of
what the dataset and decision boundaries look like. Using SVG keeps the repo
text-only and avoids binary diffs.

- `sample_moons.svg` shows two moon-shaped arcs with a light background.
- `sample_results.svg` shows two side-by-side color regions, hinting at how the
  classical (left) and quantum (right) decision boundaries may differ.

The images are intentionally simple so that the repository stays lightweight
while still providing a visual reference.
